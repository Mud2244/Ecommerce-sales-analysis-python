# 📊 E‑Commerce Sales Analysis Using Python

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project presents an **end‑to‑end data analysis workflow** on an e‑commerce sales dataset using **Python**.
It is designed as a **portfolio‑ready, client‑friendly project** that demonstrates practical skills in **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and basic machine learning**.

All outputs (cleaned data, charts, and analysis reports) are generated automatically by running a single Python script.

---

## 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset contains transactional e‑commerce data with the following key attributes:

* Order ID and order date
* Product name, category, and brand
* Sales platform (Amazon, Jumia, Souq)
* City‑wise sales information
* Price, quantity, and total amount
* Customer ratings and review counts

**Source:** Kaggle (E‑commerce sales dataset)

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – data cleaning & manipulation
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – data visualization
* **Scikit‑learn** – machine learning (sales prediction)
* **VS Code** – development environment

---

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

1. Load and inspect raw data
2. Clean and preprocess data
3. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
4. Analyze sales by platform, category, and city
5. Create and save visualizations
6. Train a machine learning model for sales prediction
7. Export cleaned data and analysis reports

---

## 📊 Key Visualizations

The following visualizations are generated and saved automatically:

* Total sales by platform
* Category‑wise revenue distribution
* Monthly sales trend
* Relationship between ratings and total sales

### 📸 Sample Outputs (Screenshots)

Below are sample charts generated by the project. These images are automatically created when the script is executed.
